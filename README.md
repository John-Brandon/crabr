Crabs are tasty. Not so much when eating them can kill you and your family. 

During 2015, the west coast of the U.S. experienced anomolously warm sea-surface temperatures (SST). Phytoplanktin abundance went through the roof (fueled by the warm water). Certain phytoplanktin result in domoic acid in the food chain. This lead to a closure of certain shell-fish fisheries. 

In particular, the dungeness crab fishery was closed in the U.S. states of California (and to a lesser exten in Oregon and Washington).

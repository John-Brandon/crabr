Crabs are tasty; not so much when eating them can kill you. 

During 2015, on the west coast of the U.S., the otherwise seasonally reliable NW spring winds never materialized. These winds usually peak over the spring and summer. They drive upwelling (colder water from depth is exported to the surface). Hence, places like California experienced anomolously warm sea-surface temperatures. Phytoplanktin, a microspopic marine organism thrives in such conditions. Their abundance went through the roof. 

Certain phytoplanktin result in high levels of domoic acid in the food chain. Domoic acid at high levels can killy you. This lead to a closure of certain shell-fish fisheries along the U.S. west coast. 

In particular, the dungeness crab fishery was closed in the U.S. states of California (and to a lesser exten in Oregon and Washington).

Crabs are tasty; not so much when eating them can kill you. 

During 2015, on the west coast of the U.S., the otherwise seasonally reliable NW spring winds never materialized. Wind speeds usually peak over the spring and summer. The onshore winds drive upwelling. Colder water from the depths is exported to the surface, via the Coriolis Effect. The same physics (Coriolis) results in a 50 yard -- North-South -- field goal attempt being deflected by 0.5 inch to the right (Neil DeGrasse Tyson). At any rate, the effect of the lack of wind resulted in places like California experiencing anomolously warm sea-surface temperatures. Phytoplanktin, or marine micro-algae, thrives ("blooms") under such conditions. 

Certain phytoplanktin species can result in high levels of domoic acid in the food chain. Domoic acid at high levels is extremely toxic to humans. Domoic acid is a nuerotoxin, and can lead to death. [Why don't crabs die then??] This lead to a closure of certain shell-fish fisheries along the U.S. west coast. 

In particular, the dungeness crab fishery was closed in the U.S. states of California (and to a lesser exten in Oregon and Washington).

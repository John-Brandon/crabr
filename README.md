Crabs are tasty; not so much when eating them can kill you. 

During 2015, on the west coast of the U.S., the otherwise seasonally reliable NW spring winds never materialized. These winds typically drive upwelling, which moves colder water from the depths to the surface. The lack of wind resulted in places like California experiencing anomolously warm sea-surface temperatures. Phytoplanktin, or marine micro-algae, thrives ("blooms") under such conditions. 

Certain phytoplanktin species can result in high levels of domoic acid in the food chain. Domoic acid is a nuerotoxin, and at high levels it is extremely toxic to humans. High levels of domoic acid lead to a closure of certain shell-fish fisheries along the U.S. west coast. 

In particular, the dungeness crab fishery was closed in the U.S. states of California (and to a lesser exten in Oregon and Washington).
